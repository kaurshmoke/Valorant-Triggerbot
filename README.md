Introducing AHK Triggerbot, the quickest Python-based triggerbot available for Valorant. Its speed is impressive, boasting reaction times as low as 2-10ms, which is near-instantaneous for a Python bot.

Key Features
Ultra-fast Reaction Time: The triggerbot reacts based on your monitor's refresh rate, with performance measured between 2-10ms, making it one of the fastest triggerbots written in Python.
Customizable Hotkeys: You can assign any key as your trigger hotkey by editing the config.json file. Simply replace the trigger_hotkey with the virtual key code of your choice. Find the codes here.
Setup Instructions
For Developers: You can build the bot from the source code if you’re familiar with coding.
For Non-Coders: Use the pre-compiled executable.
Steps:

Start the executable.
Launch Valorant, and in the in-game settings, apply a purple outline to enemies.
Go to keybinds and set "K" as a secondary shoot key.
By default, the hotkey is set to "Shift." If you’ve enabled the "always-on" mode, switch to "F10."
You can also tweak the bot's color tolerance (recommended range: 20-70) or add a delay through the config.json file.

The executable isn’t hosted on GitHub but can be downloaded from UnknownCheats.

FAQ
Is it safe to use?
While the risk is low, there's always a chance of getting banned. To minimize risk, consider compiling the source yourself and adding extra security layers like VMP.

Can it be even faster?
It’s already extremely fast, but you can speed it up further by adding DXCAM or multithreading. Writing it in a native language would also boost performance.

Why was this released?
Because why not? Enjoy the competitive edge!

P.S. The executable is compiled using Nuitka.
